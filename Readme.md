# Federity Overview 

Federity is basically a blockchain-based GitHub for collaborative machine learning 
on super sensitive data (e.g., Hospital patient's data) 

You can train ML models on your private data, but nobody else can access this 
personal data because it is never shared with anyone. 

For training, the server sends a lightweight version of the ML model to your 
device, which is trained locally on your device. Only the model updates are sent 
back to the central server as commits and aggregated. No data ever leaves your 
device. Users can then decide whether to merge the commits into their models or 
revert them. Just like GitHub, you can also version control your ML models and 
make the models unlearn their commits. 

It's like a community ChatGPT where the AI learns from your chats, but in this 
case, neither OpenAI nor anyone else can access your texts.  

With this, AI models can evolve continuously on sensitive data while ensuring 
complete privacy protection. 

And since it's blockchain-based, every activity is recorded on the ledger, is 
verifiable, and nobody can manipulate the data
